Welcome to my Digital Garden. This is the place where I share my progress and goals as I
walk through my life. 

In 2022, I grew a lot. Both physically and mentally. I started going to gym, gained some weight. 
I got emotionally stronger and started to love myself. My near and dear FD helped me realise 
what is more important in life. I learned that nothing is more important in life than making 
yourself a better person. Its still a long way. Most importantly its marathon and not sprint.

I want to take this moment and tell my future self that, I am trying my best to make "Future Me" 
proud. I have quite a few simple but imporant goals for 2023.

## My 2023 Goals

1. **Improve Health**

Health should be the first priority. In this past year since I started going to gym, I realised 
that, If you stay healthy, you stay happy. After gaining some weight and muscles, I got 
confident. The most important benefit was I started to look much better. People around me 
started to praise me that I look handsome. They asked me to help them join gym as well. Its best 
feeling when people start to admire you and your progress.

So in 2023, I want to gain even more weight maybe around 55 to 60 KG.

2. **Improve my English communication skills**

This may sound silly goal, as you might say. You are writing in English so you need to improve 
on skill. Well I can understand and write english in pretty basic way. I am not at all satisfied 
with my progress in English. When I start to speak in English my mind goes blank. I start to 
doubt myself which leads to other person think that I am not confident.

So in this year I want to feel confident when I speak in English. I have quite a good knowledge 
but I fail to share with the world when it comes to share it with English. Improving this skill 
will open lots of opportunities for me. For starters I can start conversation with native 
English speakers. I can give talks without having to worry about failing to express in English.

3. **Start some personal projects**

As a developer, I should always keep improving my skills. The easier way to do that is building 
projects, for starters I will start taking inspiration from many [Self hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)
projects.

The tech stack I want to focus is:

* Golang
* Postgres/Mysql
* AWS
 
I also plan to get quite a few AWS certificates. I want to build my career in Devops field. So I 
will explore in depth in this field and will create notes on my learning along the way.

4. **Start with technical writing**

A good practice to learn something faster and help us get clear grasp of concepts is writing. I 
want to create as many technical content as I can. I plan to write daily small learning and 
pusblish them as miniblogs. The project will be called as [**TIL by Samyak**](https://til.samyakb.com)  

5. **Read books**

Reading makes us wise. I bought kindle in 2022 with a goal to help me build vocabulary and 
improve english. I didn't read much books in 2022, So in 2023 I have goal to read more than 20+ 
books.

I will share my learning from the book as form of blog posts.


## Final goodbye to 2022.

Thank you 2022 for every special moment you gave. I want to thank people around me to believe in me.
Last but not least, I wanna thank me, for pushing myself to limits, for having the growth mindset.

Thank You
